Simple Visualization of the Logistic Function proposed by Pierre Verhulst in 1838  

This project visualizes the Logistic Function Curve with respect to the initial concentration and rate provided.  
There are various features of the logistic curve that can be observed as *Rate -> 3* and *Rate > 3*.  
The entire project does not use any logistic function pre-defined model but generates on the go. 

**Chaos Map** (Bifurcations) have been added.  

#### [DEMO](https://logistic-visualizer.netlify.app/) of the application.  
To know more about the project and understand various parts of the graphs, make sure to read the **(About Section)(https://logistic-visualizer.netlify.app/about)**.
